# Stock Analysis

This repository contains python scripts that I am devleoping to perform analysis on stock prices and visualization of stock prices and other data such as volume.

Some of the goals I want to achieve with this project include:
  - Get the data I need from Yahoo Finance or other API. Able to specify what I need and the time range.
  - Different regression implementations on the close price data. (Linear, SVM, etc.) Possibly try to fit a polynomial function which follows the data.
  - Predicting Stock price for the next day.

## Regression

Using my code for linear regression and Nvidia's (NVDA) stock prices of each day. I got a slope of 0.1850399032986727 and a y intercept of 24.54867003005582. The 50.08 number is the price predicted for the next day based on the linear formula it calculated.

```python
[0.1850399032986727, 24.54867003005582]
50.0841766853
```
